This is a game I'm making for Adventure Jam (http://jams.gamejolt.io/adventurejam).

The game uses a javascript game engine skeleton made in a workshop with Mary Cook.

It also uses the tips on rendering sprites found here: http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-sprite-animation/
